        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Khadiga Yehia . I am <em>19</em> years old. My birthday is on the 8<sup>th</sup> of september. I am from <em>Egypt</em>. I have 5 siblings - 3 girls and 2 boys. My favorite hobby is <em>crochet</em>. My favorite sport is <em>swimming</em>. I studied most of my years in Egypt and recently came to <em>Canada</em>. I speak <em>Arabic</em> and <em>English</em>. When I first came to Canada, I studied in person for a year and a half, and after that, when <abbr title=" Coronavirus disease">COVID</abbr> 19 came, I continued in <abbr title="Virtual Learning Environment">VLE</abbr>. I want to be a web designer and graphic designer after graduation. I love learning very much, and learning more, and trying things that I donâ€™t know because This is what could change the path of my life.<blockquote>To learn something new, you need to try new things and not be afraid to be wrong. -<cite>Roy T. Bennett</cite></blockquote>

            One of the goals that I achieved during the past period, which was very interesting, is that I  joined a Bazaar(it is like selling in multiple markets or plaza complexes) recently, and this was one of the very enjoyable things for me. I offered some of the <em>desserts</em> and <em>pastries</em> that I make and found a reasonable demand for them. One of my goals that I want to achieve after graduation, work with my degree and collect a lot of money, that I want to open a food <em>business</em>.

            One of the interesting things for me is traveling and exploring places. I came to <em>Canada</em> about <em>5</em> years ago, and this was a completely different experience. Also, since I came to Canada, I have traveled <em>twice</em> to Egypt. Additionally, When I was young, I traveled to <em>Saudi Arabia</em> 3 times. For me, traveling means that I feel like I am in another world. Every country I went has different cultures, civilizations, places, atmospheres, and vibes. Moreover ,I love civilizations, nature, and cultures very much. Additionally, I enjoy learning new things when I visit different countries and trying new <em>experiences.</em>
